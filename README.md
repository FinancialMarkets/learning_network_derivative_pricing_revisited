[Hutchinson, Lo, and Poggio (1994)](http://cbcl.csail.mit.edu/projects/cbcl/publications/ps/hutchinson-lo-poggio-jfinance-1994.pdf) provide a proof-of-concept of using learning networks to price and hedge options.  Since then learning network models, and computational power, have increased exponentially. Recently [high-quality software](https://www.tensorflow.org/) has been released which provides cutting-edge methods to the masses.

Here we use HLP's results as a benchmark, to measure the improvement of learning network methods to derivative pricing.
